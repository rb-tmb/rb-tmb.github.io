### Research Assistant, [Agile Robotics & Perception Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/), NYU (April 2022 - present)
- Design, simulation and fabrication of mechanical and electro-mechanical components for UAVs including the frames, sensor mounts and reinforcement of enclosures.
- Application development in ROS for docking and flying maneuvers, simulation in RViz before real-time flights in Vicon/VIO settings
- Creating documentation for design, fabrication, build and assembly for hardware and software, maintaining BOM, managing 3D printers (FDM&SLA) with maintenance and training for new students

### Teaching Assistant, NYU (Sept 2022- May 2023)
- Assisted Prof. Giuseppe Loianno by leading discussion section nad grading assignments for Foundation of Robotics(Fall 2022) & Robot Localization & Navigation (Spring 2023)
- Robot Localization: Kalman Filters and Optical Flow Algorithms in MATLAB
- Foundation of Robotics: MATLAB assignments (also simulink modelling)

### Mechanical Engineer - Factory Automation, [SEP India Pvt Ltd](https://www.sepindia.in/), India (Sep 2018 - Jul 2021)
- Responsible for development of Gantries(OEM) that can autonomously run a CNC machine
- Developed the pneumatic circuits with actuators for gripping the parts and moving them around the cell
- Also headed the autonomous inspection cell, programming CMMs and contour inspection machines

### Engineering Project Intern - Farm Automation, [Mahindra Research Valley](https://www.mahindra.com.au/2021/07/19/mahindra-research-valley-mrv/) (2017 - 2018)
- Assisted the engineering team by coming with a solution for autonomous inspection of grape vineyards to inspect and harvest crops with minimal human errors
- Designed a rotovator with a tachometer attached to the less vibrational part to monitor the health of blades and give accurate indication for replacement after a certain usage period
- This solution was effective in reducing the customer complaints about increased fuel consumption when using the company's rotovator for their tractor
